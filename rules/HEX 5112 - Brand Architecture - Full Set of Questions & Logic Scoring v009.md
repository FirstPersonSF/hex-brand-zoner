# **Federated Brand System: Rationale & Scoring** 

## Logic Chain Table Questions

Note: This scoring system supports consistency in brand decisions, but final judgments should factor in evolving business context, executive priorities, and legal considerations. Use as a directional tool—not a substitute for leadership alignment.

## 

## STEP 1: Rule Out Zone 4 → High-Stakes Independence

This step identifies brands that are critical to Hexagon’s future strategy. These are not legacy assets—they are forward-looking brands with clear ownership, growth plans, or transformative potential. Brands that qualify for Zone 1 are often used to lead a category, define a new platform, or represent a strategic investment area.  
We ask: Does this brand reflect where Hexagon is going?

Purpose: To identify brands that must remain independent due to regulatory, strategic, reputational, or contractual risk.  
Zone Eligibility: Z4, Z3, Z1  
Scoring Type: Binary, Bracketed, and Gating logic  
Zone 4 \= Prohibitive Risk Zone

### 🔹 Z4 Q1 Awareness Breadth & Independent Recognition (mindshare)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | What is the brand’s unaided awareness level across 3+ global regions, and is it recognized independently of Hexagon? | Brand Equity | Bracketed | \>70% \= \+2 Z4, 50–70% \= \+2 Z3, 30–49% \= \+1 Z3, \<30% or unknown \= \+3 Z1/Z3 | ✔ \+2 Z4 / ✔ \+2 Z3 / ✔ \+1 Z3 / ✔ \+3 Z1/Z3 |

Please select one:  
☐ Greater than 70% unaided and not attributed to Hexagon (+2 Z4)  
☐ 50–70% unaided and/or partially attributed (+2 Z3)  
☐ 30–49% unaided and/or weak Hexagon linkage (+1 Z3)  
☐ \<30% unaided or mostly attributed to Hexagon (+3 Z1/Z3)  
☐ No unaided data, but widely cited in analyst/peer references (+2 Z3)  
☐ No data and not widely recognized externally (+3 Z1)

Why We Ask:  
Establishes global mindshare breadth and independence of recognition (not leadership).

How to Answer:  
Use 2024 brand studies or proxy signals (analyst/RFP/client references). Don’t assume low awareness without evidence.

Clarification:  
Distinction vs Q10): Q1 tests unaided mindshare across regions; Q10 tests category leadership rank plus neutrality impact. Keep both to avoid conflating mindshare with market-share leadership.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Should we reframe the question to “Is the brand ranked \#1 or \#2 in the market?” 

“Ranked \#1 or \#2” may measure market share or category leadership, not mindshare It risks confusing strategic importance with brand equity

---

### 🔹 Z4 Q2 — Market Trust / Channel Neutrality Risk (endorsement friction)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2 | Would adding Hexagon branding (e.g., logo or name) to this brand create reputational harm or reduce trust in its primary markets—even with explanation or customer education? | Brand Risk | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z4, No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z4 |

Please select one:

☐ Yes–Visible Hexagon branding would reduce trust, neutrality, or channel viability (+2 Z4)  
☐ No – Endorsement would not materially reduce trust or perceived neutrality (0)

Why We Ask:  
Some brands operate in sensitive sectors (e.g., OEM software, defense, regulated industries) where visible Hexagon affiliation may reduce customer confidence or channel viability.

How to Answer:  
Consult business unit leaders, sales/channel managers, and legal if needed. Use evidence of OEM friction, customer attrition, or distributor feedback tied to Hexagon visibility.

Clarification:  
This question is not limited to reputation in PR terms. It also covers strategic neutrality, resale risks, or perceived vendor bias. Even if the product is respected, association with Hexagon may disrupt how the market behaves.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: when Hexagon endorsement itself causes market friction or revenue risk due to brand associations.

* It’s not just about reputation in the PR sense.  
* It’s also about channel dynamics, competitive entanglement, and trust in third-party relationships (OEMs, partners, resellers).

So rather than change the question, we’ll enhance the “Clarification” and “How to Answer” to account for these concerns—while keeping the scoring simple and directional.

### 🔹 Z4 Q3 — Enterprise Risk Transference (legal/ethical/regulatory exposure)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 3 | Would fully linking this brand to Hexagon expose the company to reputational, regulatory, or ethical risk that outweighs the benefits of integration? | Strategic Isolation | Binary | Yes \= \+3 Z4, No \= 0 | ✔ \+3 Z4 |

Please select one:

☐ Yes – Endorsement would create outsized legal/ethical/regulatory exposure for Hexagon (+3 Z4)  
☐ No – Brand can be endorsed without increasing Hexagon's regulatory or ethical risk profile (0)

Why We Ask:  
Screens for enterprise-level risk (sanctions, ESG backlash, political exposure).Some brands operate in high-risk sectors where integration could trigger scrutiny, sanctions, or backlash—creating enterprise-level risk.

How to Answer:  
Consult legal, risk, or compliance officers. Consider export controls, political climates, ESG implications, or known regulatory entanglements.

Clarification:  
(Distinction vs Q2):This is not about ordinary industry regulation (e.g., medtech or energy). It's about risk transference to Hexagon—where endorsement creates unacceptable liability or reputational exposure.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: “regulated or politically sensitive” is too vague, and risks over-scoring brands that simply operate in complex industries (like Hexagon itself does).

It’s no longer just asking “is this industry sensitive?”—it’s asking:

Would endorsement cause outsized legal, ethical, or reputational risk *to Hexagon as a whole*?

This reframing makes the question fit the true intent of Zone 4: isolation out of necessity due to risk transference.

### 🔹 Z4 Q4— Strategic Conflict & Resolution Path

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 4 | Does this brand directly compete with existing Hexagon or sub-brand offerings, and there is no current plan to sunset, merge, or resolve the conflict? | Strategic Conflict | Bracketed | Yes \= \+2 Z4  No conflict \= \+1 Z3  Resolved \= \+2 Z1 | ✔ \+2 Z4 / ✔ \+1 Z3 / ✔ \+2 Z1 |

Please select one:

☐ Yes – Active functional/audience/geography competition with Hexagon or sub-brands and no integration plan exists (+2 Z4)  
☐ No – There is clear category separation; brand complements Hexagon offerings (+1 Z3)  
☐ No – There is a confirmed plan to sunset, merge, or integrate this offering (+2 Z1)

Why We Ask:  
Overlap with Hexagon offerings can confuse customers and create market friction. Brands that conflict but cannot be resolved may require separation. Brands on a path to merge should be rewarded for alignment.

How to Answer:  
Consult with division GMs, product strategists, or BU leaders. Look for product-level overlap, naming confusion, or competition for the same deals.

Clarification:  
“Conflict” includes any direct overlap in function, audience, or geography with any part of the Hexagon portfolio—not just core products. Plans to phase out or absorb the brand signal a shift toward Z1.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Ambiguity about the competition scope (Hexagon core only? Sub-brands too?) Bundled logic: It’s really asking two things—conflict and lack of resolution (i.e., no sunset plan).

Let’s address both by splitting the logic into a single clear question, but with a multi-part clarification that reflects both competitive conflict and integration inaction.

---

### 🔹 Z4 Q5 — Acquisition Agreement Prohibition (gating)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 5 | Was this brand acquired under a legal agreement that explicitly forbids Hexagon branding or co-branding? | Legal / M\&A | Binary | Yes \= **FORCES Z4**, No \= 0 | 🚫 Gating |

Why We Ask:  
Some acquisition deals legally prohibit Hexagon branding for a defined period or indefinitely. These clauses override all other logic. These restrictions take precedence over all other scoring. If such a clause exists, brand integration is not permitted—yet.

How to Answer:  
Explicit legal clauses forbidding Hexagon branding override all other logic; check Corporate Strategy/Legal and track expiry for reassessment.

Clarification:  
This is a gating condition—if true, Zone 4 is automatic. If the restriction is temporary, this assessment should be redone once the clause expires to reassess integration potential.

---

### 🔹 Z4 Q6 — Export/Sanctions/Public Association Prohibition (gating)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 6 | Is this brand restricted by export laws, sanctions, or legal barriers that prevent it from being publicly associated with Hexagon? | Compliance | Binary | Yes \= **FORCES Z4**, No \= 0 | 🚫 Gating |

Why We Ask:  
Certain technologies and markets are restricted from being visibly linked to foreign or parent organizations, due to national or export control laws.

How to Answer:  
If public association violates EAR/ITAR or equivalent controls, the brand must remain independent. Verify with Compliance.

Clarification:  
If public association with Hexagon is prohibited, the brand must remain independent for legal compliance.

---

### 🔹 Z4 Q7 — Narrative/Values Incompatibility (tone/voice fit)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 7 | Are the brand’s vision, mission, tone, or values intentionally incompatible with Hexagon’s corporate narrative—and cannot be brought into alignment? | Narrative | Binary | Yes \= \+1 Z4, No \= 0 | ✔ \+1 Z4 |

Please select one:

☐ Yes — Vision/mission/tone/values are intentionally incompatible and cannot be aligned (+1 Z4)  
☐ No — No fundamental incompatibility (0)

Why We Ask:  
Some brands’ beliefs/tone block integration even when risk/legal are fine.

How to Answer:  
Compare published vision/values and tone to Hexagon’s; confirm “intentionally incompatible.”

Clarification:  
(Distinction vs Q3): Q7 is brand-voice alignment; Q3 is exposure/risk. Only applies if alignment is fundamentally impossible.

---

### 🔹 Z4 Q8 (Refined – Objection to Full Absorption (not endorsement) into Hexagon)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 8 | Have regulators, government buyers, OEMs, or other key external stakeholders formally objected to the brand being **eliminated** and fully absorbed into the Hexagon masterbrand? | Legal / Market Risk | Binary | Yes \= \+3 Z4  No \= \+1 Z2 | ✔ \+3 Z4 ✔ \+2 Z1 |

Please select one:

Yes — Regulators/government buyers/OEMs formally object to eliminating the brand (full absorption) (\+3 Z4)  
☐ No – No formal objections to full absorption of this brand (\+2 Z1)

Why We Ask:  
In rare cases, external forces require a brand to remain visibly independent. Regulatory, contractual, or strategic objections may prohibit Hexagon from retiring a brand’s identity.

How to Answer:  
Check with Legal and M\&A. Look for acquisition clauses, government stipulations, or formal stakeholder concerns tied to preserving the brand name and logo.

Clarification:  
This question refers exclusively to full absorption (Zone 1)—where the original brand is retired and only the Hexagon identity remains. 

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: This question focuses specifically on external objections to the elimination of the brand, meaning its full absorption into the Hexagon masterbrand (Zone 1). It does not address concerns about endorsement, co-branding, or lockup treatments, which are evaluated separately in Z4 Q2.

---

### 🔹 Z4 Q9 — Non-Negotiable Contract/OEM/Reseller Invalidations

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 9 | Would rebranding this offering under the Hexagon name or logo cause the loss, renegotiation, or invalidation of formal contracts, OEM terms, or third-party sales models that require brand independence? | Commercial Risk | Binary | Yes \= \+3 Z4, No \= 0 | ✔ \+3 Z4 |

Please select one:

☐ Yes — Branding under Hexagon would invalidate/trigger loss of formal contracts, OEM/VAR, or reseller models (\+3 Z4)

☐ No – All current agreements can remain intact or be adjusted with standard branding changes (0)

Why We Ask:  
This question identifies brands with hard commercial constraints that cannot operate if rebranded. Some brands operate under sensitive agreements that limit or prohibit branding changes. OEMs, public institutions, or channel partners may require the brand to remain independent in name or appearance.

How to Answer:  
Review major contracts with Legal and Commercial teams. Look for branding clauses, rebranding triggers, or exclusivity terms in OEM/reseller or government partnerships. This includes direct contracts, OEM/VAR models, and reseller/distributor agreements where affiliation with Hexagon may present a commercial barrier.

Clarification:  
(Distinction vs Q8): Q9 is contractual mechanics; Q8 is formal stakeholder objection to elimination.This question is about non-negotiable commercial risks.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: This question was refined to focus only on formal legal or structural risks, such as contract loss or invalidation. Based on input from Flavia and Rick, we removed gray areas around channel preferences and clarified that only non-negotiable, legal barriers trigger a Z4 classification here.

### 🔹 Z4 Q10 (New — Category Leadership and Neutrality Impact)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 10 | Is this brand consistently ranked among the top 2 providers in its category across 3+ strategic regions, and would endorsement by Hexagon weaken its equity or neutrality? | Brand Equity | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z4  No \= \+2 Z3A | ✔ \+2 Z4 / ✖ \+2 Z3A |

Please select one:

☐ ☐ Yes — Brand is consistently Top-2 across 3+ strategic regions and Hexagon endorsement would weaken its neutrality/equity (\+2 Z4)  
☐ No – Top-ranked, but can be safely endorsed or locked up with Hexagon (+2 Z3A)

Why We Ask:  
Separates high-equity brands that must remain independent from those that benefit from endorsement. But equity alone doesn’t place a brand in Z4, only if endorsement would undermine it. This question separates high-equity brands that must remain independent from those that benefit from endorsement.

How to Answer:  
Use analyst rankings, industry awards, or global RFP performance. Combine with regulatory or reputational insight from business or legal teams.

Clarification:  
The purpose of Zone 4 is to identify brands that must remain independent due to legal, regulatory, or reputational risks—not simply because they’re strong performers. Z4 (Distinction vs Q1): Q10 \= ranked leadership \+ neutrality effect; Q1 \= unaided awareness breadth.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Should we reframe the question to “Is the brand ranked \#1 or \#2 in the market?” 

If a brand ranks \#1 or \#2, that alone doesn’t push it toward Z4 unless that leadership is paired with factors that *prevent endorsement* (e.g., political neutrality, defense restrictions, or category conflicts with Hexagon).

Therefore, we should reposition this question as a potential *Z3A qualifier* (Lockup or standalone equity), and *only apply Z4 points when independence is justified*.

---

### 🔹 Z4 Q11 (New — Trademark Status & Conflict

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 11 | Is the brand name currently under active trademark dispute, opposition, or pending registration in key markets (e.g., EU, US, APAC)? |  Legal / IP Protection | Binary | Yes \= **\+3 Z4**, No \= 0 | ✔ \+3 Z4  |

Please select one:

☐ Yes — Active dispute / opposition / pending status in key market (\+3 Z4)  
☐ No — Fully registered and uncontested (0)

Why We Ask:  
If trademark ownership or exclusivity is uncertain, the brand cannot be rebranded or endorsed without legal exposure. This question isolates IP uncertainty as a gating condition for integration.

How to Answer:  
Verify with Corporate Legal and IP Counsel. Confirm registration or opposition records through USPTO, EUIPO, or WIPO.

Clarification:  
Distinct from Q5 (Acquisition Agreement Prohibition). Q5 tests contractual ownership rights; Q11 tests the brand name’s legal availability and protection status..

---

### 🔹 Z4 Q12 (New  — Time-Based Lock or Buy-Out Period)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 12 | Is there a legal or contractual lock-up or buy-out period restricting brand name or identity change?  | Legal / M\&A | Bracketed | \< 6 months \= **\+2 Z1/Z3**, 6–12 months \= **\+2 Z3**, ≥ 12 months \= **\+3 Z5** |  |

Please select one:

* ☐ \< 6 months — No material restriction (\+2 Z1/Z3)  
* ☐ 6–12 months — Moderate restriction (\+2 Z3)  
* ☐ ≥ 12 months — Significant restriction (\+3 Z5)

Why We Ask:  
Acquisition and licensing agreements often include time-based naming locks. The duration directly influences zone placement and migration timing.

How to Answer:  
Consult M\&A Legal and Corporate Strategy for binding clauses, renewal options, and buy-out timelines.

Clarification:  
When the restriction expires, the brand should be re-evaluated for Z3 endorsement or Z1 absorption. This question determines temporary placement, not permanent status.

---

### 🔹 Z4 Q13 (New — Contractual Co-Branding Obligation)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 13 | Do any active contracts require the brand to maintain distinct branding or shared lockups with partners for a defined period?  | Commercial / Legal Risk | Binary | es \= **\+2 Z4**, No \= 0 |  |

Please select one:

* ☐ Yes — Contractually obligated distinct branding or shared lockup (\+2 Z4)  
* ☐ No — No co-branding requirement (0)

Why We Ask:  
Certain OEM, VAR, or partnership agreements mandate brand co-visibility for compliance or market continuity. These agreements temporarily prevent full integration.

How to Answer:  
Review OEM and Reseller contracts with Commercial Legal for branding clauses and expiry dates. Identify co-marketing terms requiring joint visual representation.

Clarification:  
Differs from Q9 (Contract/OEM Invalidation). Q9 tests risk of loss if branding changes; Q13 tests obligation to maintain current branding.

---

### 🔹 Z4 Q14 (New —  Pending Litigation or IP Dispute)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 14 | Is the brand involved in any active litigation, IP dispute, or regulatory investigation that could affect naming rights or ownership?  | Commercial / Legal Risk | Binary | Yes \= **\+2 Z4**, No \=\+2 Z1 & Z3 |  |

Please select one:

* ☐ Yes — Active legal dispute or investigation (\+2 Z4)  
* ☐ No — No active litigation or IP dispute (+2 Z1 & Z3)

Why We Ask:  
Active legal matters freeze brand migration and endorsement until resolved. Litigation exposure increases Hexagon’s enterprise risk.

How to Answer:  
Consult Legal for current dockets and regulatory filings. Include patent, trademark, licensing, and corporate suit status.

Clarification:  
Distinct from Q11 (Trademark Status). Q14 covers any legal action that could affect future ownership or commercial use of the brand.

---

## STEP 2: Rule Out Zone 5 → Legal / Accounting / Integration Hold

Here we evaluate whether a brand has achieved category-level leadership or dominant market mindshare, independent of Hexagon. These brands are recognizable in the wild—named by analysts, selected in RFPs, or chosen by customers for what they uniquely stand for.

Zone 2 brands are rare but valuable.  
We ask: Would consolidating this brand mean losing a category-defining signal?

Purpose: To identify brands that are temporarily ineligible for integration due to legal, operational, or strategic limitations.  
Zone Eligibility: Zone 5 only  
Zone 5 \= Transitional or In-Process Brands  
These questions are evaluated only after Zone 4 is ruled out.

### 🔹 Z5 Q1 — Legal or Compliance Restriction

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Is the brand currently subject to any active **legal, compliance, or contractual restriction** (e.g., joint-venture agreement, regulatory hold, consent decree, or naming limitation) that prevents adoption of the Hexagon brand or identity? | M\&A Lifecycle | Binary | Yes \= **FORCES Z5**, No \= 0 | 🚫 Gating |

Please select one:

☐ Yes – Legal or regulatory restriction prevents Hexagon branding → FORCES Z5  
☐ No – No active restriction → Continue evaluation (0)

Why We Ask:  
This is a primary gating condition. Some brands are legally blocked from integration for a period of time due to compliance, licensing, or JV agreements. This ensures integration actions don’t breach binding conditions.

How to Answer:  
Confirm with Legal, Corporate Strategy or Compliance. Provide documentation, including expiration dates or conditions. Once lifted, rerun this brand through the Logic Chain.

Clarification:  
If true, this condition overrides all other scoring. Re-evaluate once the restriction expires or is lifted. If true, stop and classify as Z5.

---

### 🔹 Z5 Q2 — Integration Plan Existence and Intent

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2 | Is there a **documented and approved integration roadmap or communication plan** that aligns this brand to the Hexagon masterbrand or an endorsed identity within the next 12 months? | M\&A Status | Binary | Yes \= \+1 Z1 & Z3, No \= \+3 Z5 |  |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes – There is a plan to transition this brand into the Hexagon masterbrand (Z1) or become an endorsed brand (Z3) → Remain outside Z5

☐ No – No integration plan exists; the brand is in a transitional or undefined state → Z5 candidate (+3)

Why We Ask:  
This identifies whether the brand is actively moving toward full integration or intentionally being kept independent. Some brands need time to transition, but this should be explicit—not assumed. If no plan is known, the respondent should consult Business Unit leadership or Strategy.

How to Answer:  
Refer to M\&A brand strategy documentation or internal transition plans. Brands without clear integration paths (Z1 or Z3) may be considered transitional.

Clarification:  
This question screens for any active integration direction, whether into the masterbrand (Z1) or endorsed structure (Z3). If integration is underway, the brand may exit Z5 sooner. If separation is planned, the brand remains transitional until re-evaluated.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Feedback noted that the original question was compound and could be misread. The updated version separates the logic into a single binary decision focused on whether a formal integration plan exists—toward either Z1 or Z3. This reframing preserves the original intent (to rule out Z5 if integration is active) while improving clarity and reducing ambiguity.

---

### 🔹 Z5 Q3 — Transition Timeline Defined (12 Months)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 3 | Is there a planned sale or divestiture expected within 12 months? | Strategic Planning | Bracketed | Yes \= \+3 Z5, No \= \+1 Z1 / \+1 Z3 | ✔ \+3 Z5 |

Please select one:

☐ Yes – Milestone defined and resourced →  \+3 Z5  
☐ No – planned sales of divestiture → \+1 Z1 \+Z3

Why We Ask:  
Brands marked for sale or separation should remain clearly transitional to avoid investing in integration or rebranding prematurely.

How to Answer:  
Consult Corporate Strategy or your division’s strategic planning office. If confidential, confirm intent without disclosing sensitive deal terms.

Clarification:  
This ensures we don’t integrate brands scheduled to exit the portfolio.

---

### 🔹 Z5 Q4 Brand Integration Forecast

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 4 | Is this brand expected to adopt Hexagon’s identity system, merge with another Hexagon sub-brand, or integrate fully into the Hexagon brand within 12 months? | Integration Intent | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z1, \+2 Z3 No \= \+3 Z5 | ✔ \+2 Z1 / ✔ \+2 Z3 / ✔ \+3 Z5 |

Please select one:

☐ Yes – The brand is being integrated, merged with another Hexagon brand, or adopting Hexagon’s identity system → Move toward Z1 or Z3

☐ No – A rebrand, rename, or new identity is planned that deviates from Hexagon standards → Temporary Z5 placement

Why We Ask:  
This question forecasts whether the brand is on a defined path toward absorption or endorsement—or if it is temporarily diverging from Hexagon’s visual and strategic identity.

How to Answer:  
Check with Corporate Strategy or Divisional Brand teams. Review brand strategy documents or rebrand proposals to determine direction and alignment.

Clarification:  
Z5 is a transitional zone. Brands expected to merge, integrate, or adopt the Hexagon system should move toward Z1 or Z3. Those planning new standalone identities without integration belong in Z5 until reevaluation.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: This question was clarified to distinguish between brands actively integrating into Hexagon (e.g., adopting identity, merging with sub-brands) and those planning divergent visual or verbal identities. Feedback from multiple reviewers noted ambiguity in terms like “go beyond,” so the question was reframed for binary clarity. The scoring was also adjusted to reward brands moving toward Z1 or Z3 while retaining Z5 logic for short-term separations.

---

### 🔹 Z5 Q5 — Market Testing / Incubation Status

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 5 | Is the brand still in early-stage market testing, in **pilot, incubation, or proof-of-concept stage**, with limited commercial rollout or temporary branding? | Visibility | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z5, No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z5 |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes – Active pilot / POC status → **\+2 Z5**  
☐ No – Fully commercialized or post-launch → 0

Why We Ask:  
Emerging brands or initiatives often need time to prove value before integration decisions can be made. Premature alignment could distort results or reduce flexibility.

How to Answer:  
Check with initiative leads or business owners. Look for pilot-stage language, MVP references, or non-standard brand treatments.

Clarification:  
This includes internal ventures, stealth launches, or test-phase platforms that haven’t been operationalized.When performance data matures, brand can progress to Z3 or Z1 evaluation.

---

### 🔹 Z5 Q6 (New) Explicit Separation Strategy

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 6 | Has this brand been formally approved to remain separate from Hexagon for a limited time (12 months or less), with a documented plan to revisit integration? | Strategy & Transition | Binary | Yes \= \+3 Z5 No \= \+1 Z1, \+1 Z3 | ✔ \+3 Z5 / ✔ \+1 Z1 / ✔ \+1 Z3 |

Please select one:

☐ Yes – A formal, time-bound separation (≤12 months) has been approved and documented, with a required integration review

☐ No – No approved or time-bound transition plan exists

Why We Ask:  
Z5 is a temporary zone for brands with a formal, short-term separation strategy. This question confirms that separation is explicit, limited in duration, and leads toward integration (Z1 or Z3).

How to Answer:  
Consult post-close brand strategy documentation, BU leadership, or Corporate Strategy. If there’s no formal timeline or review plan, the answer is No.

Clarification:  
A brand may not remain in Z5 without a documented plan to integrate within 12 months.A “No” answer suggests the brand is trending toward Z1 or Z3 and should not default to Z5.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: This logic was originally embedded in Z4 Q2 but was split out and reassigned to Z5 to more accurately reflect temporary separation scenarios. The updated version removes vague references to “culture,” clarifies the requirement for a documented 12-month integration review, and rebalances scoring: a “No” answer now nudges toward Z1 or Z3, reinforcing Z5’s transitional purpose.

---

### 🔹 Z5 Q7 — Active Legal Constraint (Gating)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 7 | Are there any active legal constraints (e.g., litigation, export sanctions, acquisition clauses) that prohibit this brand from adopting the Hexagon name, logo, or identity—regardless of strategic intent? | Risk / Legal | Binary | Yes \= **FORCES Z5**, No \= 0 | 🚫 Gating |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes – Legal or regulatory issues prevent any use of the Hexagon brand FORCES Z5  
☐ No – No such constraints exist → Continue evaluation

Why We Ask:  
In rare cases, active litigation, export sanctions, or other legal risks require brand separation until resolved. Legal actions or sanctions override strategic intent and freeze brand integration activity.

How to Answer:  
Check with Legal, Compliance, or Corporate M\&A for constraints in M\&A agreements, export control status, or government licensing.

Clarification:  
Only use “Yes” if restrictions completely block Hexagon association; delays alone do not qualify.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Clarified the question to reference specific legal examples—such as litigation, sanctions, or acquisition clauses—to avoid confusion between operational and legal concerns. This ensures the evaluator understands this is a hard legal stop, not a subjective or strategic delay.

---

### 🔹 Z5 Q8 New — Operational Autonomy Assessment

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 8 | Does the brand currently operate with independent systems, HR, finance, or sales functions outside Hexagon’s framework? | Organizational Integration | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z4, No \= \+3 Z5 |  |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes – Operates independently → \+2 Z4  
☐ No – Uses Hexagon shared systems → \+3 Z5

Why We Ask:  
Operational independence often correlates with cultural and brand independence; it delays integration readiness.

How to Answer:  
Confirm system ownership and shared-service participation with Operations and Finance.

Clarification:  
This tests operational embedding, not brand awareness. Brands fully onboarded to Hexagon systems are easier to rezone to Z3 or Z1.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: New After Revisiting Legal Requirements

### 🔹Z5 Q9 — Financial Stability Checkpoint

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 9 | Has the brand sustained positive year-over-year revenue growth since acquisition or launch? | Performance / Financials | Bracketed | \> 15 % YoY growth \= \+2 Z3, Flat \= \+3 Z5, Declining \= \+2 Z1 |  |

Please select one:  
☐ \> 15 % YoY growth → \+2 Z3  
☐ Flat (± 5 %) → \+3 Z5  
☐ Declining growth → \+2 Z1

Why We Ask:  
Stable financial performance supports integration readiness; decline signals re-evaluation or absorption.

How to Answer:  
Use audited financials or forecast reports for the past 12 months.

Clarification:  
Financial stability is a proxy for market acceptance and management control. Integration should follow demonstrated growth.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: New After Revisiting Legal Requirements

## STEP 3: Evaluate for Zone 1 → Full Masterbrand Integration

Before testing for embedded value, we must first ensure that the brand is designed to play a subordinate role within the Hexagon system. This step screens out brands that still present as independent: separate logos, standalone websites, or unique stories.  
Only brands that visually or narratively support Hexagon—or can be adjusted to do so—should continue to Step 4\.

We ask: Is this brand ready to operate under the Hexagon umbrella?

Purpose: To identify brands that are fully embedded into Hexagon’s systems, offer no standalone equity risk, and can be fully absorbed under the Hexagon masterbrand.  
Zone Eligibility: Z1, Z3  
Scoring Range: Binary, Bracketed  
Scoring Purpose: Confirm operational integration, equity dependency, and visual consistency

### 🔹 Z1 Q1 \- Divisional Revenue Contribution

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Does the brand contribute a significant portion of its division’s total revenue? | Revenue | Bracketed | \>70% \= \+9 Z2B (Leica only), 20–70% \= \+2 Z3A, \<20% \= \+3 Z1 | ✔ \+9 Z2B / ✔ \+2 Z3A / ✔ \+3 Z1 |

Please select one:

☐ Greater than 70% of division-level revenue (e.g., Leica Geosystems) → Z2B candidate (+2)  
☐ Between 20%–70% of division-level revenue → Z3A candidate (+2)  
☐ Less than 20% of division-level revenue → Z1 candidate (+3)

Why We Ask:  
Revenue contribution is a reliable indicator of brand dependence, customer recognition, and integration risk. Higher contribution suggests higher market equity

How to Answer:  
Review current divisional financials or ARR reports. Revenue should be calculated as a percentage of the entire division’s revenue for the past fiscal year. Use trailing 12-month data if available. Round to the nearest bracket.

Clarification:  
High contribution brands (Z2B/Z3A) retain visibility for continuity. Low contribution brands (\< 20 %) qualify for full masterbrand integration (Z1).

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:Feedback raised concerns about how revenue contribution should influence zone assignment, particularly for high-contributing brands like Leica. To address this, we refined the brackets to better reflect governance intent: brands contributing \>70% are directed to Z2B (reserved exclusively for Leica), 20–70% suggests an endorsed identity (Z3A), and brands contributing \<20% are likely Z1 candidates. This revision ensures that strategic equity is preserved where appropriate and avoids over-simplifying brand value as purely financial.

When it comes to equity in the marketing/strategic sense, there isn’t a universal benchmark like “5–10% of capitalization.” It’s more contextual: equity is measured by belief in the brand (customer loyalty, pricing power, category differentiation) and that doesn’t always show up neatly in the revenue line until it erodes.

As for integration — the risk of “equity loss” in rebranding is usually proportional to how quickly a brand’s recognition and trust are collapsed into the parent. Some companies (e.g., Microsoft) integrate aggressively, others (e.g., P\&G) maintain distinct brands for decades. The calculation usually comes down to: what premium does the brand command today, and how much of that are we willing to risk for operational or portfolio efficiency? 

In short: Revenue % is the clean financial lens. Equity is the strategic lens. Integration requires weighing both, and deciding which part of the business absorbs the “loss” (short-term revenue vs. long-term brand premium).

### 🔹 Z1 Q2 \- Embedded Brand Integration

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2 | Is the brand exclusively or partially embedded within a combined Hexagon solution—or does it operate as a standalone offer? | Integration | Bracketed | Exclusively embedded \= \+3 Z1, Partially embedded \= \+2 Z3 / \+1 Z1, Standalone \= \+2 Z3 or Z4 | ✔ \+3 Z1 / ✔ \+2 Z3 / ✔ \+2 Z4 |

Please select one:

☐ Exclusively embedded – This brand is fully merged within a Hexagon solution or ecosystem and is not marketed independently. (+3 Z1)  
☐ Partially embedded – Some elements are integrated, but the brand retains visible independence in its go-to-market. (+2 Z3 / \+1 Z1)  
☐ Standalone – The brand is sold and operated entirely independently of Hexagon offerings. (+2 Z3 or Z4)

Why We Ask:  
This question helps determine how deeply the brand is integrated into Hexagon’s solutions. Fully embedded brands are easier to absorb into the Hexagon masterbrand, while partially or standalone brands may require endorsement or special handling.

How to Answer:  
Check how the brand appears in customer-facing contexts: Is it co-marketed as part of a Hexagon platform? Is it functionally necessary to a combined solution? Consult sales materials, solution architecture, or GTM plans.

Clarification:  
“Embedded” refers to brands that are integrated into a broader offering—technically, commercially, or visually. Partial embedding means the brand plays a support or modular role in a solution, while still being sold or positioned under its own name.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Feedback indicated that the original question lacked clarity around what constitutes “embedded.” The question and scoring were refined to distinguish between full and partial integration. This ensures partial embedding can still contribute to Z1 eligibility, while maintaining accuracy in zone scoring.

### 🔹 Z1 Q2B (Trigger – Residual Identity Retention) – Answer only if Q2 \= Embedded)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2B | Even if the brand is embedded, is there a desire or plan for it to retain any standalone identity (e.g., logo, name, product icon, or distinct visual)? | Brand Identity | Bracketed | Plan to retain full logo \= \+3 Z3A, Name only \= \+2 Z3B, Product icon only \= \+2 Z3C, No planned retention \= \+3 Z1 | ✔ \+3 Z3A / ✔ \+2 Z3B / ✔ \+2 Z3C / ✔ \+3 Z1 |

Please select one:

* ☐ Yes – There is a desire to retain the brand’s distinct logo alongside Hexagon (+3 Z3A)  
* ☐ Yes – The logo will be retired, but the name will remain as a sub-brand (e.g., Hexagon Nexus) (+2 Z3B)  
* ☐ Yes – A product icon or badge will remain for continuity (+2 Z3C)  
* ☐ No – The brand is expected to be fully absorbed into Hexagon with no distinct identity (+3 Z1)

Why We Ask:  
Even embedded brands may retain visual or verbal elements. This question helps determine whether a brand is headed toward full absorption or some form of endorsed/sub-brand identity.

How to Answer:  
Check with divisional or corporate brand leadership to confirm forward-looking branding intentions, especially in transition plans.

Clarification:

* Z3A: Brand retains visual logo within a Hexagon lockup  
* Z3B: Brand name used as text only (no logo)  
* Z3C: Product-level badge/icon retained  
* Z1: No visual or name-based identity carried forward

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:Language reframed to reflect intent and planning rather than current state. Captures future visual/verbal branding strategy and aligns answers with Z3 sub-types or Z1 absorption.

### 🔹 Z1 Q3 — Intentional Masterbrand Naming

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 3 | Was the brand intentionally created, renamed, or positioned to carry the Hexagon name? | Naming | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3B, No \= \+1 Z1 | ✔ \+2 Z3B / ✔ \+1 Z1 |

Please select one:

☐ Yes – Designed as a Hexagon initiative → \+2 Z3B

☐ No – No Hexagon naming intention → \+1 Z1

Why We Ask:  
This helps identify brands designed to live under Hexagon’s masterbrand—especially new initiatives or renamed entities that reflect intentional integration.

How to Answer:  
Review launch plans, naming decisions, or strategy decks. If the brand was built to support or extend Hexagon, and leads with its name, it likely fits Z3B.

Clarification:  
Z3B includes initiatives like R•Evolution—distinct names, but tied closely to the Hexagon identity.

---

### 🔹 Z1 Q4 – Visual Identity Intent & Usage

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 4 | Does the brand currently use and or intend to fully adopt Hexagon’s visual identity system (logo, colors, typography) without retaining its own standalone name, logo or design system? | Brand Identity | Bracketed | Full adoption \= \+3 Z1 Partial adoption with name/logo retained \= \+2 Z3B No adoption \= \+2 Z3A | ✔ \+3 Z1 / ✔ \+2 Z3B / ✔ \+2 Z3A |

Please select one:

* ☐ Yes – Brand already uses and intends to fully adopt the Hexagon visual identity system without retaining a separate brand or logo (+3 Z1)  
* ☐ Partial – Brand uses Hexagon identity system but intends to retain its own name or brand elements alongside it (+2 Z3B)  
* ☐ No – Brand intends to retain its own identity and does not use the Hexagon system (+2 Z3A)

Why We Ask:  
This question surfaces both current brand identity behavior and strategic intent. It helps determine whether full absorption (Z1) is appropriate, or whether endorsement (Z3) paths are better suited.

How to Answer:  
Ask divisional leadership or BU marketers about visual strategy, future brand plans, or recent guidance. Reference style guides, branding roadmaps, or rebrand initiatives.

Clarification:

* Z1: No retained brand name or visual identity outside Hexagon  
* Z3B: Retains brand name but adopts Hexagon visuals (e.g., Hexagon – R-Evolution)  
* Z3A: Retains both brand name and logo in lockup format

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:Updated the question to incorporate strategic intent, not just current usage. This prevents false positives where brands use Hexagon branding temporarily but plan to retain legacy identity. Refined language to distinguish Z1 from Z3 pathways more clearly.

### 🔹 Z1 Q5 – Functional Replacement by Hexagon

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 5 | Is there a desire or plan to functionally replace this brand with the Hexagon name in all go-to-market activities (e.g., naming, marketing, sales)—or has this already occurred? | Visibility | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z1, No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z1 |

Please select one:

* ☐ Yes – There is a clear plan or desire to replace this brand with Hexagon, or this replacement has already occurred → (+2 Z1)  
* ☐ No – There is no plan or desire to fully replace the brand with Hexagon → Consider Z3 placement

Why We Ask:  
This question tests whether the brand is (or will be) functionally replaced by Hexagon in market-facing activities, signaling readiness for Zone 1\. Some legacy brands still exist in systems or documentation, but are no longer used externally. If Hexagon now leads all naming and communication, that suggests a fully absorbed identity.

How to Answer:  
Check with brand and business leaders. Choose “Yes” if Hexagon is expected to—or already does—own the go-to-market identity (naming, positioning, selling).

Clarification:  
“Functionally replaced” means the brand no longer appears as the customer-facing name. If a product name remains in use (e.g., Geomagic) but is no longer presented as a standalone brand, it may be a candidate for Z3C—where product names persist but the parent brand identity is Hexagon.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Clarified the distinction between full brand replacement (Z1) and retained product-level naming (Z3C). Revised language to cover both current and planned transitions.

---

### 🔹 Z1 Q6  — Internal-Only Brand Visibility

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 6 | Is the brand visible only internally (not customer-facing)? | Visibility | Binary | Yes \= **MANDATE Z1**, No \= \+1 Z3 | ✔ Z1 / ✔ \+1 Z3 |

Please select one:

* ☐ Yes – Internal program/tool only → MANDATE Z1  
* ☐ No – Visible externally → \+1 Z3

Why We Ask:  
Internal brands (e.g., tools, programs, initiatives) should not follow external brand architecture. These are governed by naming and internal branding—not visual endorsement or zone logic.

How to Answer:  
Ask whether this brand is ever seen by customers, partners, or the public. If not, it is treated as an internal designation and moves directly to Z1.

Clarification:  
This question is a redirect. Internal-only brands do not qualify for Zones 2–5 and are automatically placed in Z1.

---

### 🔹 Z1 Q7— Residual Public Brand Assets

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 7 | Are there any significant standalone brand assets still visible to the public (e.g., website, logo, social media)? | Visual Identity | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3, No \= \+2 Z1 | ✔ \+2 Z3 / ✔ \+2 Z1 |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes – Active public assets exist → \+2 Z3  
☐ No – All legacy brand assets retired → \+2 Z1

Why We Ask:  
Active public-facing brand assets suggest continued separation and external presence. If none exist, the brand may be ready for full absorption.

How to Answer:  
Audit the brand's digital presence—look for distinct websites, social handles, or standalone collateral. If these are gone or redirect to Hexagon, answer “No.”

Clarification:  
This helps determine whether a brand still holds public visibility or if it’s been fully integrated into Hexagon’s digital ecosystem.

---

### 🔹 Z1 Q8 — Customer Perception of Hexagon Ownership

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 8 | In customer-facing materials (proposals, web, events), does referencing **Hexagon** materially improve trust/credibility for this brand? | Brand Perception | Bracketed | Yes \= \+2 Z1, No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z1 |

Why We Ask:  
If the brand depends on Hexagon’s reputation for legitimacy or influence, it indicates dependency—and supports a case for full masterbrand integration.

How to Answer:  
Evaluate how the brand is introduced in customer materials, proposals, or events. If Hexagon is always referenced to build confidence or explain credibility, answer “Yes.”

Clarification:  
This is about perceived trust—if customers expect Hexagon to vouch for or stand behind the offering, it belongs closer to the core.

### 🔹 Z1 Q9 – Legal Restriction on Absorption (Gating)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 9 |  Is there an **active legal/contractual clause** that **prohibits** retiring the brand’s **name and logo** (i.e., prevents “Hexagon-only” identity)? | Legal Compliance | Binary | Yes \= **BLOCK Z1**, No \= \+2 Z3A | 🚫 Gating / ✔ \+2 Z3A |

Please select one:

* ☐ Yes – A legal, regulatory, or contractual clause prevents this brand from being rebranded solely as “Hexagon” → Not eligible for Z1  
* ☐ No – No such legal block exists; the brand could legally be absorbed into Hexagon → (+2 Z3A)

Why We Ask:  
Some brands are bound by legal or contractual terms that prohibit full rebranding as Hexagon. This gating question ensures brands with such restrictions are excluded from Zone 1 and instead considered for an endorsed placement (e.g., Z3A)

How to Answer:  
Confirm with Legal, Corporate Strategy, or M\&A documentation. This question is not about channel sales, GTM badges, or third-party product requirements. It applies only if the brand name and logo must remain intact due to binding constraints.

Clarification:  
This does not apply to reseller rules or co-marketing needs. It applies only if the brand cannot be rebranded as Hexagon due to legal obligations (e.g., joint venture terms, restricted name rights, exclusivity clauses).

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Clarified that this question applies only to legal blocks on full absorption into Hexagon (Z1), not general GTM or channel concerns. Added scoring logic to nudge “No” answers toward Z3A to support brand endorsement paths when Z1 is not legally restricted.

### 🔹 Z1 Q10 \- Projected Brand Growth (Next Fiscal Year)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 10 | Is this brand expected to grow more than 10% as a standalone entity in the next fiscal year (e.g., revenue, ROE, EPS, or market expansion)? | Growth & Future Fit | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3A / Z3C No \= \+2 Z1 | ✔ \+2 Z3A / Z3C / ✔ \+2 Z1 |

Please select one:

* ☐ Yes – The brand is forecasted to grow more than 10% as a standalone entity (in revenue, ROE, EPS, or market expansion) in the next fiscal year → (+2 Z3A or Z3C)  
* ☐ No – The brand is not projected to grow materially or independently → (+2 Z1)

Why We Ask:  
Brands with material growth potential as independent entities may benefit from retaining identity under Hexagon’s endorsement model (Z3). Brands without this trajectory are typically stronger candidates for absorption (Z1).

How to Answer:  
Use brand-level forecasts, ROE/EPS metrics, and standalone market expansion strategies. Consult corporate strategy and divisional leadership teams for guidance. If multi-year trends exist, factor them into your answer and don't rely on a single-year anomaly.

Clarification:  
This question focuses on independent brand growth over the next fiscal year. A brand expected to grow meaningfully without needing to be absorbed is more suited for Z3A or Z3C. Those lacking that projection are better aligned with Z1. Patterns of diminishing growth (e.g., from 20% to 10% to 5%) suggest the brand may not sustain a standalone future.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Clarified the time horizon to next fiscal year and added “as a standalone entity” to ensure answers reflect independent brand viability—not just product or divisional performance. Retained clear growth metrics and trend logic to ground scoring.

### 🔹 Z1 Q11 – Brand Investment Signal

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 11 | Is the brand currently receiving—or is there a plan to provide—investment in demand gen or brand-building? | Strategic Investment | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3 No \= \+2 Z1 | ✔ \+2 Z3 / ✔ \+2 Z1 |

Please select one:

* ☐ Yes – The brand is receiving, or is slated to receive, dedicated brand marketing or demand gen investment → \+2 Z3  
* ☐ No – There is no notable marketing investment at this time → \+2 Z1

Why We Ask:  
Marketing investment is a signal that a brand still holds independent visibility or value. Brands with no marketing support are typically candidates for full absorption into Hexagon (Z1).

How to Answer:  
Check if the brand appears in any active or planned marketing budgets, campaign plans, or demand gen initiatives. This question is not about the size of investment—only whether it exists.

Clarification:  
A “No” signals that the brand has no strategic momentum as a separate identity, and likely should not remain separate from Hexagon.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Scoring corrected: “Yes” votes now support Z3, indicating endorsement viability. “No” answers now push toward Z1, identifying brands with no investment or visibility. Removed quantitative thresholds as per Marcello's guidance.

### 🔹 Z1 Q12 – Source of Brand Value

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 12 | Is the brand’s value primarily tied to its people, technology, or solutions—rather than to its name, logo, or market identity? | Brand Equity | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z1 No \= \+2 Z3 | ✔ \+2 Z1 / ✔ \+2 Z3 |

Please select one:

* ☐ Yes – The brand’s market value comes mostly from its offerings or team, not its name or logo → \+2 Z1  
* ☐ No – The brand name or identity contributes materially to customer perception or market strength → \+2 Z3

Why We Ask:  
This question distinguishes between brands that hold intrinsic market equity and those whose value is operational or technical. If a brand’s value is not tied to its identity, it’s more likely to be absorbed into Hexagon (Z1).

How to Answer:  
Evaluate what customers recognize and respond to: the name and logo, or the solutions and team behind them? If the brand name could disappear with no loss of perception or preference, that’s a strong Z1 signal.

Clarification:  
A brand may be “known” without holding standalone value. This question helps identify when a name carries equity and when it doesn’t.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:  
Refined the question to better reflect brand equity vs. operational value. Clarifies that Z1 is appropriate when identity is not core to customer value. A “No” signals that the brand name has market weight and may warrant Z3 treatment.

---

### 🔹 Z1 Q13 (Optional Add)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 13 | Is this brand required for internal operations, tooling, or automation and never seen by customers? | Operational Role | Binary | Yes \= **MANDATE Z1**, No \= 0 | ✔ Z1 |

Why We Ask:  
Some brands only exist to power internal workflows or systems. If they serve no public-facing role, they should be absorbed under Hexagon's internal brand framework.

How to Answer:  
Ask IT, Ops, or Product teams. Confirm if the brand appears in any external materials.

Clarification:  
This is stronger than “not externally visible” (Q6). It confirms the brand’s sole purpose is internal enablement.

---

### 🔹 Z1 Q14 (Optional Add)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 14 | Has this brand already been replaced across all touchpoints (CRM, sales, web, support, docs) by Hexagon? | Lifecycle | Binary | Yes \= \+3 Z1, No \= 0 | ✔ \+3 Z1 |

Why We Ask:  
A fully decommissioned brand may still appear in obscure places. This confirms total lifecycle replacement across internal and external systems.

How to Answer:  
Audit CRM, documentation, product portals, and support systems. Confirm Hexagon is now the only visible brand.

Clarification:  
Use when Hexagon has fully taken over all digital, sales, and support touchpoints—even if some legacy remnants remain buried.

## STEP 4: Evaluate for Zone 3 → Endorsed Brand Architecture

This step evaluates whether a brand should be retained within Zone 3 based on operational, market, legal, or functional entrenchment. These brands often serve real roles in customer workflows, partner ecosystems, product UX, or go-to-market effectiveness—even if they lack standalone strategic intent. The goal is not to elevate these brands, but to understand what risk or value is created by removing or retiring them too quickly.

Zone 3 brands fall into one of three sub-zones:

* Z3A – Lockups (strong legacy or strategic partnerships; high transition or commercial risk)  
* Z3B – Sub-brands (high commercial equity, roadmap investment, or market reference)  
* Z3C – Integrated Products/Services (embedded in user flows, technical stacks, or low-risk visual support)

These 35 questions test various dimensions of brand entrenchment, including:

* Operational Dependency: Is the brand required for onboarding, support, or technical continuity?  
* Commercial Visibility: Does the brand appear in sales cycles, generate leads, or create customer preference?  
* Legal/Partner Constraints: Are there post-acquisition clauses, co-branding requirements, or IP conditions?  
* Visual Misalignment: Is the brand currently represented in ways that conflict with Hexagon’s system?

Each response contributes to a cumulative score and Zone 3 sub-type recommendation. Brands with significant Z3 scores may not warrant promotion—but they must be managed with clarity, care, and consistency.

### 🔹 Z3 Q1 – Existing Brand Alignment

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Does the brand already appear with Hexagon in-market (e.g., co-branded pages, joint decks/events, or shared visual components) such that endorsement is observable today? | Brand Alignment | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3 No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3 |

Please select one:

☐ Yes — Repeated, current co-appearance or shared visuals in customer-facing assets → \+2 Z3

☐ No – The brand appears independently, with no consistent association to Hexagon → 0

Why We Ask:  
Confirms endowment-in-practice—endorsement behavior that already exists and can be formalized.

How to Answer:  
Review external materials: websites, brochures, social posts, product demos, and sales decks. Has Hexagon’s identity been actively included—or could it be added without resistance or confusion?

Clarification:  
This is not about forced co-branding. We’re identifying brands where endorsement is already happening—or could naturally happen—because of market proximity or business alignment.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:  
Original question was overly vague and could be interpreted too broadly. Updated to clearly emphasize observable partial integration and alignment with Hexagon branding, helping distinguish natural Zone 3 candidates.

### 🔹 Z3 Q2—Part of a Larger Hexagon Platform/Ecosystem

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2 | Is the brand formally part of a **named Hexagon platform/ecosystem or product family** (i.e., a **sub-brand role** vs. standalone brand)? | External Equity | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3B, No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3B |

Please select one:

☐ Yes — Listed/marketed as a platform component or named family → \+2 Z3B

☐ No — Not attached to a Hexagon platform/family → 0

Why We Ask:  
Brands that operate as components of a broader solution—like a suite, platform, or connected system—are ideal for sub-branding under the Hexagon name. This reflects their role in a larger value chain, not as independent market-facing brands.

How to Answer:  
If the brand is part of a named platform, ecosystem, or shared product line (e.g., “Hexagon Nexus”), answer “Yes.” If it stands alone or outside shared systems, answer “No.”

Clarification:  
This question identifies Sub-brand candidates—those that support Hexagon's strategy but don’t require individual brand independence.

### 🔹 Z3 Q3 – Brand Marketed Primarily Under Hexagon

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 3 | Is the brand (product/service/solution) **marketed primarily under Hexagon** in external-facing materials (Hexagon-first naming, headline, or category placement)? | Product Structure | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3 No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3C |

Please select one:

☐ Yes – The brand is (or will be) presented primarily as part of Hexagon in key external materials (e.g., websites, presentations, packaging, UIs) → \+2 Z3

☐ No – The brand is currently and expected to remain marketed with a distinct identity, separate from Hexagon → 0

Why We Ask:  
This question identifies brands that are—or are moving toward being—externally positioned under Hexagon, signaling endorsement suitability rather than full independence.

How to Answer:  
Check whether Hexagon is the lead brand in customer-facing channels today, or if there is a near-term plan to shift in that direction. If Hexagon leads now or soon will, select “Yes.”

Clarification:  
Applies to all brand types: product, service, solution, or initiative. If Hexagon is the primary brand customers see—or will soon see—mark “Yes.”

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:  
This question was revised to directly include product, service, and solution brands—addressing client confusion around what “brand” refers to in this context. It now captures both current and intended future marketing alignment with Hexagon, improving clarity and differentiation from prior questions.

### 🔹 Z3 Q4

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 4 | Do customers primarily interface with this brand via an independently branded portal or website? | UX & Systems | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3A/Z3B,  No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3A/Z3B |

Please Select One:

☐ Yes – Customers primarily interact with this brand through a standalone digital experience (e.g., branded website or portal) → Z3A or Z3B candidate (+2)  
☐ No – The offering is accessed through Hexagon systems or shared platforms → No impact on Z3 scoring

Why We Ask:  
Persistent, branded digital touchpoints suggest the brand maintains its own market-facing presence—often aligned with Z3A or Z3B. This helps determine the level of visual independence retained.

How to Answer:  
Check whether customers engage with a unique UI, login portal, or public-facing site that’s branded separately from Hexagon. Confirm with Product or Digital teams if unclear.

Clarification:  
This helps distinguish between Sub-brand (Z3B) and Integrated (Z3C) identity based on customer interaction.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:  
Simplified to a single, focused question. Retains ability to signal a Z3A or Z3B classification without overcomplicating scoring or logic.

### 🔹 Z3 Q5 \- Brand Awarness

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 5 | Does this brand outperform Hexagon in formal equity metrics (unaided awareness, NPS/recommendation, Share of Voice, trust) based on large‑scale studies? | Brand Equity | Bracketed | \+2 Z3A \+2 Z3B 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3A ✔ \+2 Z3B |

Please Select One:  
☐ The brand significantly outperforms Hexagon on multiple formal metrics → \+2 Z3A  
☐ The brand modestly outperforms Hexagon or shows comparable equity → \+2 Z3B  
☐ The brand does not outperform Hexagon (or data unavailable) → 0

Why We Ask:  
This question identifies brands whose independent equity is strong enough to retain their logo under Hexagon’s endorsement architecture (Z3A) or at least merit a name with Hexagon parent (Z3B). Formal, large‑scale metrics such as those tracked by YouGov BrandIndex—including unaided recall, recommendation, impression, quality and value scores—provide the necessary evidence

How to Answer:  
Review external brand health trackers (e.g., YouGov BrandIndex) across markets and time‑series. Key metrics: unaided awareness/recall, Net Promoter Score or recommendation rates, Share of Voice, brand trust or impression. If your brand leads Hexagon meaningfully, mark accordingly.

Clarification:  
Z3A \= Brand retains its logo under Hexagon endorsement because it has demonstrable superior equity.

Z3B \= Brand keeps its name (but not necessarily full visual identity) because equity is solid but not significantly higher than Hexagon.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:  
We introduced bracketed scoring to allow differentiation between strong (Z3A) vs moderate (Z3B) outperformance of Hexagon’s brand equity. Also clarified reliance on formal external studies (e.g., YouGov) to avoid subjective judgment.

### 🔹 Z3 Q6

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 6 | Is the brand currently designed to stand alone, with its own logo, website, or independent story? | Design System | Binary | Yes \= \+2 (Z3B), No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3B |

Why We Ask:  
Standalone design choices signal a strategic desire to keep the brand separate. This supports sub-branding rather than integration.

How to Answer:  
Check for a distinct logo, separate domain or website, and independent brand story or messaging. If these elements exist and are actively used, answer “Yes.”

Clarification:  
Use caution here—distinct logo ≠ full identity system. We’re looking for brands that have been intentionally built or maintained as independent—not just those that haven’t been updated yet.

### 🔹 Z3 Q7

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 7 | Would this brand benefit from clearer Hexagon attribution in external materials, ensuring customers understand its connection to Hexagon? | Brand Retention | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3A, No \= \+1 Z3B | ✔ \+2 Z3A / \+1 Z3B |

Please select one:

☐ Yes – The brand would benefit from more visible Hexagon attribution (e.g., lockup, visual alignment) to clarify its relationship to Hexagon → Z3A candidate (+2)  
☐ No – The current brand structure sufficiently reflects Hexagon, or added attribution isn’t needed → Z3B candidate (+1)

Why We Ask:  
This question helps identify whether the brand should be brought visually closer to Hexagon or already fits well as a standalone entity within the endorsed family.

How to Answer:  
Look at existing external brand expressions (website, presentations, sales materials). Would stronger Hexagon visibility help clarify ownership or alignment 

Clarification:  
This surfaces brands needing stronger connection and co-brand balance—often candidates for Z3

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:  
Client concerns centered on the original question combining both past and future scenarios, and the vague phrasing around "clearer attribution and balanced presentation." The question was rewritten to focus solely on the forward-looking benefit of stronger Hexagon attribution.

### 🔹 Z3 Q8a – Risk of Identity Removal

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 8a | Would **removing the brand name and switching to Hexagon alone** create significant risk of customer confusion, loss of trust, or disruption in key markets? | Brand Risk | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3A/Z3B risk‑flag, No \= \+1 Z1 | ✔ \+2 Z3A/Z3B ✔ \+1 Z1 |

Please select one:

☐ Yes – Removing the brand name and using only Hexagon would likely cause customer confusion, erosion of trust, or market disruption → Z3A or Z3B candidate (+2)  
☐ No – Transitioning to Hexagon alone poses minimal risk of confusion or brand loss → Z1 candidate (+1)

Why We Ask:  
Removing a brand’s name may signal a loss of identity—if that carries risk, it suggests the brand should retain its name (Z3A or Z3B). A low-risk removal supports Hexagon-only identity (Z1).

How to Answer:  
Evaluate market feedback, partner/channel dependence, contract terms, brand heritage in regions, and potential \>12‑month sales impact.

Clarification:  
Focus is on risk of name removal, not design or styling changes.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:  
Original question was split to separate brand risk from transition complexity. “Clearer attribution” now handled in separate items.

### 🔹 Z3 Q8b – Brand Transition Complexity

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 8b | If a transition to Hexagon‑only branding were required, is the **scope and complexity** of that change substantial (e.g., multi‑region rollout, partner/OEM contracts, more than 12 months impact)? | Transition Scope | Binary | Yes \= \+1 Z3A, No \= \+2 Z3B | ✔ \+1 Z3A ✔ \+2 Z3B |

Please select one:  
 ☐ Yes – The transition is large-scale (global markets, many partners/OEMs, \>12 months of disruption expected) → Z3A candidate (+1)  
 ☐ No – The transition is relatively easy (limited regions or partners, minimal disruption) → Z3B candidate (+2)

Why We Ask:  
If the brand can be easily transitioned, it supports moving to a simplified name under Hexagon (Z3B). More complex changes justify a lock-up model (Z3A).

How to Answer:  
Check business case documentation, partner arrangements, digital or packaging dependencies, and customer migration timelines.

Clarification:  
This measures the operational difficulty of rebranding—not the desire or intent.

### 🔹 Z3 Q9

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 9 | Is this brand expected to grow into a multi-division platform or family of offerings? | Strategic Horizon | Binary | Yes \= \+2 (Z3B), No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3B |

Why We Ask:  
Brands positioned as scalable platforms often require distinct but endorsed identities to support expansion across divisions or solution areas.

How to Answer:  
Check strategic roadmaps. If the brand is being built to support multiple solutions, divisions, or integrations, answer “Yes.”

Clarification:  
Z3B is suited for platform brands that need flexibility while still connecting visibly to Hexagon.

### 🔹 Z3 Q10 – Marketing Independence and Resourcing

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 10 | Does the brand have an independent marketing team and budget, separate from Hexagon central/corporate resources?? | Operations | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3A/B, No \= \+2 Z3C | ✔ \+2 Z3A ✔ \+2 Z3C |

Please select one: 

Yes – The brand maintains its own marketing staff, budget, or campaign strategy separate from Hexagon's corporate structure → Z3A candidate (+2)   
No – Marketing efforts are shared, managed, or operated using Hexagon's systems, teams, or budget → Z3C candidate (+2)

Why We Ask:  
Independent marketing infrastructure suggests a brand requires distinct market presence and resource autonomy—a key trait of sub-brands (Z3A). Shared or embedded systems support a quieter, integrated endorsement (Z3C).

How to Answer:  
Check if the brand has a distinct marketing team and budget line, separate from division- or group-level shared services. Involvement from Hexagon’s corporate or divisional marketing teams typically indicates integration.

Clarification:  
Independent marketing support is a key indicator of brand autonomy. Brands lacking this should be treated as embedded offerings under Hexagon, often with minimal external identity (Z3C).

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:  
Original framing focused on tools and teams but lacked clarity. Revised to assess structural independence via dedicated marketing team and budget—more accurately flags Z3C candidates.

### 🔹 Z3 Q11

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 11 | Is there a long-term plan to sunset this brand and transition to Hexagon-only naming? | Product Structure | Binary | Yes \= \+2 (Z3C), No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3C |

Why We Ask:  
Understanding whether the brand is on a path toward full integration helps determine if subtle endorsement or eventual absorption is the right approach.

How to Answer:  
Check internal roadmaps or leadership plans. If there’s a formal or strategic move toward retiring the brand in favor of Hexagon, answer “Yes.”

Clarification:  
This signals alignment with Hexagon and helps shape a phased brand strategy.

### 🔹 Z3 Q12

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 12 | Would a dual-logo lockup create confusion or redundancy in brand identity? | Product Structure | Binary | Yes \= \+2 (Z3C), No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3C |

Why We Ask:  
Some brands don’t benefit from lockups due to overlap or unclear attribution. This identifies where simpler brand treatment is cleaner.

How to Answer:  
Evaluate if putting two logos together muddies the message or feels repetitive. If yes, lockup may not be effective.

Clarification:  
Z3C brands may require light-touch endorsement or simplified identity to avoid clutter.

---

### 🔹 Z3 Q13

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 13 | Is the brand’s equity tied to a founder, region, or cultural legacy? | Product Structure | Binary | Yes \= \+2 (Z3A), No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3A |

Why We Ask:  
Legacy brands often warrant visual retention to honor heritage or maintain regional market strength.

How to Answer:  
If the brand’s story or appeal stems from a person, place, or long-standing identity, answer “Yes.”

Clarification:  
Z3A helps preserve cultural equity while connecting to Hexagon.

### 🔹 Z3 Q14 – Rebranding Risk to Trust or Recognition

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 14 | Would adopting Hexagon’s visual identity system (as a sub-brand or endorsed brand) reduce customer trust or recognition in key markets? | Customer Impact | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3A, No \= \+2 Z3B | ✔ \+2 Z3A / ✔ \+2 Z3B |

Please select one:

☐ Yes – Customers might lose trust or fail to recognize the brand if it adopts Hexagon’s visual identity, even as an endorsed or sub-brand → Z3A candidate (+2)  
☐ No – Rebranding under Hexagon would not negatively affect trust or recognition → No movement toward Z3A (possible lean toward Z1 or Z3B elsewhere)

Why We Ask:  
All Z3 brands will move toward some level of Hexagon alignment. This question clarifies how much of a brand’s identity should be retained or removed in favor of the Hexagon identity.

How to Answer:  
This question applies to brands expected to adopt Hexagon’s identity within the endorsed/sub-brand system (Z3). Assess whether customers strongly associate trust or value with Hexagon.

Clarification:  
Z3 brands integrate into Hexagon’s system. This question helps decide if the current logo must be retained or can be replaced with Hexagon’s logo without harming trust.

Notes from Feedback:  
Updated to clarify that Z3 implies alignment with Hexagon, and that “rebranding” refers specifically to modifying the brand’s logo, not full masterbrand absorption as in Z1

### 🔹 Z3 Q15

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 15 | Could the brand’s equity realistically be transferred to Hexagon with clear communication over \~18 months? | Integration Viability | Binary | Yes \= \+1 (Z3B), \+2 (Z3C); No \= 0 | ✔ \+1 Z3B or \+2 Z3C |

Why We Ask:  
This tests whether the brand’s current value can be absorbed without long-term damage—signaling potential for brand simplification.

How to Answer:  
Ask marketing, product, and customer-facing teams whether a 12–18-month transition plan could successfully shift awareness to Hexagon.

Clarification:  
This helps distinguish brands that require long-term endorsement (Z3A) from those that can be phased out with good communication (Z3B or Z3C).

---

### 🔹 Z3 Q16

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 16 | Does the brand have public-facing materials still in use across major geographies? | Marketing Footprint | Binary | Yes \= \+1 (Z3A), No \= 0 | ✔ \+1 Z3A |

Why We Ask:  
Continued use in public campaigns suggests lingering equity and the need for controlled endorsement.

How to Answer:  
Check for region-specific sites, PDFs, brochures, ads. Ask regional marketing leads to confirm.

Clarification:  
“Still in use” \= currently distributed or referenced in marketing or sales.

### 🔹 Z3 Q17— Own Logo or Design Misalignment (rule compliance)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 17 | Does the brand use **its own logo or non-conforming design system** (color/typography/layout) that **violates Hexagon brand standards**? | Design Attribution | Binary | Yes \= \+2 (Z3C), No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3C |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes — Visuals don’t conform to standards → \+2 Z3C  
☐ No — Visuals conform or use approved lockups → 0

Why We Ask:  
Some offerings use their own styling in ways that compete visually with Hexagon, signaling an unclear or misaligned brand hierarchy.

How to Answer:  
Review current marketing materials, product sites, or pitch decks. If logos or styles are present that don’t align with brand standards, answer “Yes.”

Clarification:  
This helps flag branding that may misrepresent hierarchy or falsely signal stand-alone authority.

### 🔹 Z3 Q18 – Implied Visual Parity with Hexagon (hierarchy signal)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 18 | Does the brand’s current execution **imply parity or independence** with Hexagon (e.g., equal logo sizing, separate hero presence, primary color dominance that **signals a co-owner**)? | Design Attribution | Binary | Yes \= \+2 (Z3C), No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3C |

Please select one:

* ☐ Yes — Execution implies parity/independence → \+2 Z3C  
* ☐ No — Execution clearly subordinates to Hexagon → 0

Why We Ask:  
To prevent brand misuse or unintended implications of parity with Hexagon.

How to Answer:  
Evaluate whether the brand appears to "outrank" Hexagon visually in materials, event presence, or GTM design. If yes, answer “Yes.”

Clarification:  
Visual balance should reflect true brand hierarchy—not suggest separate ownership. diagnoses hierarchy signaling even if designs technically follow some rules.

### 🔹 Z3 Q19 – Visual Alignment Would Improve Clarity

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 19 | Would visual alignment to Hexagon improve clarity, consistency, or perceived authority in the market? | Design Attribution | Binary | Yes \= \+2 (Z3A/B/C), No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3A/B/C |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes — Alignment would meaningfully improve outcomes → \+2 Z3A/B/C  
☐ No — Alignment would not change market perception → 0

Why We Ask:  
To identify opportunities to fix or clarify inconsistent brand attribution through design adjustments.

How to Answer:  
If updated visual alignment would increase trust, reduce ambiguity, or signal integration, answer “Yes.”

Clarification:  
This supports clean endorsement and consistent brand hierarchy.

### 🔹 Z3 Q20 – (New) Channel Sensitivity Managed Through GTM Branding

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 20 | Would channel partners, OEMs, or resellers resist visible Hexagon branding—**but** remain supportive if presented with tailored GTM tools such as badges, co-branding lockups, or “Powered by Hexagon” endorsements? | Channel Fit | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3 (Lockup)  No \= \+3 Z1 | ✔ \+2 Z3 / ✔ \+3 Z1 |

Please select one:

☐ Yes — Concerns are solvable by design → \+2 Z3 (Lockup)

☐ No — Partners fine with full Hexagon identity → \+3 Z1

Why We Ask:  
This identifies situations where branding friction exists, but does not prevent integration. Instead, these brands can be supported by visual lockups, endorsement badges, or GTM flexibility, making them ideal Z3 candidates.Differentiates GTM preference from legal invalidation (which belongs in Z4 gates)

How to Answer:  
Would vendor or channel preference shift with visual branding changes? Could badging or framing maintain partner confidence?

Clarification:  
This question is not about legal invalidation (see Z4 Q9), but about go-to-market nuance. If the brand can succeed with visual compromise, Z3 is the logical outcome, not independence.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: This question was created to separate brand sensitivity from legal risk. Concerns about vendor friction or reseller preference do not qualify a brand for Z4. Instead, this allows those concerns to steer toward a Z3 lockup or endorsement strategy.

🔹 Z3 Q20 – Embedded Product Solution UI

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 20 | 1P Team, how about: in GTM activities, is this brand always associated with a broader Hexagon solution and never leveraged independently? | Product / Solution UI | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3C, No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3C |

Why We Ask:  
Feature/module branding often persists inside product UI or training, even when not marketed.

How to Answer:  
Evaluate how this brand appears online and in go to market materials.

Clarification:  
This helps distinguish deeply embedded brands that are invisible externally but still used operationally.

🔹 Z3 Q21 – Stakeholder Sentiment

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 21 | Are there strong emotional or political advocates for this brand (e.g., BU presidents, founders, regional leads)? | Stakeholder Sentiment | Binary | Yes \= \+1 Z3A/B, No \= 0 | ✔ \+1 Z3A/B |

Why We Ask:  
Brand endorsement is often political. Buy-in matters.

How to Answer:  
Gauge stakeholder sentiment in regional or BU leadership. Ask quietly.

Clarification:  
Emotional ownership alone isn’t determinative—but it may require a softer landing.

🔹 Z3 Q22 – Joint Venture or Shared IP Branding

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 22 | Is this brand part of a joint venture, OEM relationship, or IP-sharing agreement, with an external partner, where maintaining the existing brand identity is required or contractually beneficial? | Legal Partner Strategy | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3A/Z3B No \= \+2 Z3C | ✔ \+2 Z3A / Z3B (Yes) ✔ \+2 Z3C (No) |

Why We Ask:  
Some brands must retain their identity due to binding agreements—whether tied to another Hexagon entity or an external partner. This influences whether the brand stays visually distinct (Z3A/B) or can be fully integrated (Z3C).

How to Answer:  
Consult with legal or commercial leadership to confirm if an OEM, JV, or IP agreement exists that limits branding changes. If the brand must retain its identity for contractual or strategic reasons, answer “Yes.”

Clarification:  
External links (e.g., third-party brand must remain visible due to IP or OEM agreement)

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Clarified that "shared branding" applies to both Hexagon internal relationships (e.g., sub-brands or endorsements) and external contracts (e.g., OEM or IP-sharing agreements). Adjusted language to remove ambiguity and ensure the question applies to both internal and third-party preservation scenarios.

🔹 Z3 Q23 – Indirect Sales Value

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 23 | Does this brand enable indirect sales (e.g., distributor, integrator, OEM) where brand familiarity drives access or preference? | Channel Equity | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3C, No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3C |

Why We Ask:  
Channel-driven value often depends on brand familiarity—particularly in regions where Hexagon is lesser-known.

How to Answer:  
Ask regional sales, partners, or channel ops.

Clarification:  
Hexagon-only branding may weaken sell-through effectiveness.

🔹 Z3 Q24 – Regulatory, Licensing, or Contractual Risk

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 24 | Could removing or replacing this brand cause regulatory, licensing, or partner concerns? | Risk & Compliance | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3B, No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3B |

Why We Ask:  
Some brands are legally or contractually embedded in partner flows or filings.

How to Answer:  
Check partner documentation, OEM contracts, licensing agreements, and regional compliance protocols.

Clarification:  
Especially important for joint IP or vertical-market solutions.

Great. Continuing from where we left off, here are:

🔹 Z3 Q25 – Legacy Brand in Persistent Materials

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 25 | Has this brand already been visually retired but still persists in legacy documents, tools, or mindshare? | Brand Lifecycle | Binary | Yes \= \+1 Z3C, No \= 0 | ✔ \+1 Z3C |

Why We Ask:  
Highlights situations where cleanup or silent support may be better than ongoing endorsement.

How to Answer:  
Audit documentation portals, training decks, and partner libraries.

Clarification:  
These often point toward “sunset-support” brand treatment—Z3C or deprecation.

🔹 Z3 Q26 – Transition Feasability Risk

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 26 | Could this brand name be integrated as a product under Hexagon with minimal disruption? | Transition Feasibility | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3C No \= \+2 Z3A/B | ✔ Yes  \+2 Z3C ✔ No  \+2 Z3A/B |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes – The brand could feasibly be repositioned as a Hexagon product with minimal disruption to awareness, sales, or support → Z3C candidate (+2)  
☐ No – The brand’s name holds sufficient value or recognition that eliminating it would create friction or confusion → Z3A/B candidate (+2)

Why We Ask:  
This question helps determine whether a brand functions more like a product or retains significant equity. If integration would cause disruption, the brand likely merits treatment as a Sub-brand or Lockup within Z3A or Z3B.

How to Answer:  
Assess how critical the brand name is to external engagement. If customers strongly associate the name with quality, trust, or value, and replacing it could weaken recognition or require major re-education—select “No.” If the name can be easily absorbed without disruption, select “Yes.”

Clarification:  
Z3A and Z3B brands maintain their names due to continued customer recognition or market equity. Z3C brands are treated as embedded Hexagon products with minimal standalone branding.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: The updated question clarifies the distinction between product-level integration (Z3C) and brands with retained equity (Z3A/B). The reversed scoring ensures that brands whose removal would cause disruption are appropriately steered toward sub-brand or lockup treatment.

🔹 Z3 Q27 – Maintained Identity Post-Acquisition

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 27 | Should the brand’s existing visual identity (e.g., legacy logo) be retained *indefinitely* due to acquisition‑ or contract‑based obligations, rather than simply during a temporary transition (e.g., first 6‑12 months)? | Transition Equity | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3A, No \= 0 |  ✔ \+2 Z3A |

Please select one:

☐ Yes – The brand must retain its existing visual identity long‑term due to acquisition or contractual terms, which means it cannot be fully absorbed into Hexagon’s identity and is a Z3A case → \+2

☐ No – There is no such long‑term obligation; the brand’s identity can be migrated or integrated without legacy constraints → No score

Why We Ask:  
This question surfaces cases where a brand’s visual identity cannot be replaced or fully transitioned because of legal/acquisition commitments—meaning retention of the legacy mark is strategically required and the brand is best retained under the endorsed or sub‑brand model.

How to Answer:  
Check acquisition agreements, legal terms or partner/legacy contracts. Determine whether a requirement exists for the previous logo or brand identity to remain active beyond the typical 6‑12‑month transition window. If yes, select “Yes.” If the retention is only temporary or no constraint exists, select “No.”

Clarification:  
The question focuses on *long‑term* identity retention (beyond a standard transition period) that prevents full brand absorption. Temporary transition scenarios are not covered here—they may feed into other questions.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Clarified that this question addresses legacy brand identity retention under contractual or acquisition conditions, not typical short‑term transition use

🔹 Z3 Q29 – Contractual Rights for Brand Use

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 29 | Does the brand operate under a post-acquisition clause allowing continued external use for the purpose of retaining brand equity? | Legal Continuity | Binary | Yes \= \+2 (Z3A/B), No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3A/B |

Why We Ask:  
Some acquisition agreements include language that preserves external brand use for a fixed time or purpose. This impacts brand retention and sub-zone eligibility.

How to Answer:  
Consult the acquisition agreement or speak with Legal/M\&A to confirm if the brand has a contractual right to remain in use externally.

Clarification:  
Only score “Yes” if there is a formal clause in legal documentation permitting brand visibility post-acquisition. This clause typically includes duration and conditions.

🔹 Z3 Q30 – Brand-Driven Demand

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 30a | Does this brand primarily generate demand (traffic, leads, or sales) through its own brand equity, visual identity, and marketing, without using Hexagon branding or affiliation? | Brand Driven Demand | Bracketed | Yes \= \+2 Z3A, No \= \+2 Z3C  | ✔ Z3A / Z3C |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes – The brand drives demand independently, using its own identity with no reliance on Hexagon branding or equity → Z3A  
☐ No – Demand is primarily generated through Hexagon systems, branding, or association → Z3C

Why We Ask:  
This helps us understand if the brand has strong standalone equity or relies on Hexagon to drive awareness and conversion. It’s a key factor in deciding how prominently the original identity should be retained.

How to Answer:  
Ask: Does this brand operate outside of Hexagon’s marketing ecosystem? If the majority of leads, traffic, or awareness comes from microsites or campaigns that don’t include Hexagon branding, select "Yes." Otherwise, choose "No."

Clarification:  
*Only answer this for brands already in the Hexagon portfolio.*

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Clarified that this question is for *existing Hexagon brands only*. Revised language to explicitly capture whether demand is driven by independent brand equity, visual identity, and market activity—completely decoupled from Hexagon. Simplified scoring to eliminate ambiguity

🔹 Z3 Q31 – New – Acquisitions \- Brand-Driven Demand 

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 31 | Was this brand acquired (or is it being considered for acquisition) to gain credibility, access, or dominance in a market segment where Hexagon lacks strong recognition? | Strategic Leverage | New Acquisitions \- Brand Driven Demand | Bracketed | Yes \= \+2 Z2A or Z3A\<br\>No \= 0 | | ✔ \+2 Z2A/Z3A |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes – The brand unlocks strategic market access where Hexagon lacks presence → Z2A/Z3A  
☐ No – The brand complements an area where Hexagon is already well-positioned → No impact

Why We Ask:  
Some brands are acquired for their reputational advantage in markets where Hexagon lacks traction. This can justify short- to mid-term identity preservation and elevated placement in Z3A—or external co-branding logic if truly standalone.

How to Answer:  
If this brand was acquired to serve as a market-entry vehicle, open doors, or lend credibility where Hexagon has limited brand equity, select “Yes.” Consider market geography, vertical specialization, or category dominance.

Clarification:  
*Used to identify strategic rationale for non-integrated brand positioning (e.g., “we need their name to win”). Strongly supports Z3A, and in rare cases, Zone 2A (external-only).*

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK: Introduced as a new question based on client concerns about evaluating *new acquisitions*. Focuses on whether the acquired brand provides Hexagon with immediate credibility, access, or strategic positioning in a market where Hexagon has limited brand equity.

| 32 | What % of the product/platform roadmap is explicitly tied to this brand (features, releases, naming)—as opposed to generic Hexagon plans? | Strategic Dependency | Bracketed | 75% \= \+2 (Z3B), 40–75% \= \+1 (Z3B), \<40% \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3B / \+1 Z3B / 0 |

Please select one:

* ☐ ≥75% brand-led → \+2 Z3B  
* ☐ 40–74% brand-led → \+1 Z3B  
* ☐ \<40% brand-led → 0

Why We Ask:  
Determines whether the brand drives its own development roadmap, indicating its strategic role as a sub-brand platform.

How to Answer:  
Consult portfolio leads or product managers. Look for brand-specific investments, features, or naming in upcoming roadmaps. Estimate as a percentage.

Clarification:  
This reveals how integral the brand is to the business’s long-term product vision—separate from core Hexagon strategy.

🔹 Z3 Q33 – Independent Oversight (org/budget gravity)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 33 | Are there dedicated leadership, budget, or product management lines accountable specifically for this brand? | Operational Autonomy | Binary | Yes \= \+2 (Z3B), No \= 0 | ✔ \+2 Z3B |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes — Dedicated lines/owners exist → \+2 Z3B  
☐ No — Ownership is pooled under Hexagon → 0

Why We Ask:  
Identifies operational independence, which supports sub-brand treatment and long-term endorsement needs.

How to Answer:  
Check if there is a distinct team, budget line, or decision-making authority separate from Hexagon. Ask product or finance leaders.

Clarification:  
Operational autonomy often signals a need for brand-level visibility and investment protection.

🔹 Z3 Q34 – Long-Term Legacy Recognition (durable global equity)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 34 | Has the brand maintained ≥40% unaided awareness for ≥3 years in ≥2 global regions without Hexagon attribution? | Legacy Indicator | Bracketed | Yes  \+2 Z3A No  0 | ✔ \+2 Z3A |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes — Meets all three thresholds → \+2 Z3A  
☐ No — One or more thresholds not met → 0

Why We Ask:  
Identifies durable standalone equity that justifies Z3A lockup retention.

How to Answer:  
Refer to brand tracking data (e.g., YouGov, market studies, NPS surveys). “Yes” means the brand has independently maintained ≥40% unaided awareness in multiple regions over three years—without needing Hexagon visibility.

Clarification:  
This helps identify brands with enduring standalone equity across global markets, justifying retention of visual identity under a Z3A endorsement.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:Confusion centered on what qualifies as “unaided recognition” and whether the question was about trend (decline) or total awareness.We addressed this by adding a 40% threshold, specifying a three-year consistency, and clarifying the absence of Hexagon attribution.

🔹 Z3 Q35 – Declining or Region-Limited Recognition (trend/regional cap)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 35 | In the past 3 years, has unaided awareness declined significantly or remained limited to a single region? | Declining Brand Recognition | Bracketed | Yes \+2 Z3B No  0  | ✔ \+2 Z3b |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes — Decline or single-region cap → \+2 Z3B  
☐ No — Stable and multi-region → 0

Why We Ask:  
Sustained unaided recognition in multiple markets signals durable equity. Declining recognition or limited recognition supports consideration as a sub-brand or absorption into Hexagon.

How to Answer:  
Use internal brand tracking or market research to evaluate trends. A “Yes” response indicates the brand is either declining in recognition or its awareness remains geographically constrained.

Clarification:  
This helps determine whether the brand’s equity justifies reduced standalone visibility under Hexagon—supporting Z3B placement.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:Confusion centered on what qualifies as “unaided recognition” and whether the question was about trend (decline) or total awareness.This companion question (Z3 Q34) balances the logic, giving credit when brand equity is weakening or regionally limited, supporting movement toward Z3B rather than Z3A.

🔹 Z3 Q36 –  Loyalty Driven by Product Experience (NPS-Based)

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 36 | Is the brand’s equity primarily driven by product experience, as reflected in customer loyalty indicators like NPS? | Experience Loyalty | Bracketed | NPS \> 50 \= \+2 (Z3B/C) NPS 30–50 \= \+1 (Z3B/C) NPS \< 30 \= 0 \+1 Z1 | ✔ \+2 Z3B/C |

Please select one:

☐ NPS \> 50 – Strong product experience is the driver of loyalty, not identity → \+2 Z3B/C  
☐ NPS 30–50 – Some experience-driven loyalty, moderate brand risk → \+1 Z3B/C  
☐ NPS \< 30 – Weak loyalty, identity-driven or unstable → \+1 Z1

Why We Ask:  
Brands with high NPS driven by experience—not name—are good fits for Z3B or Z3C, where visual identity can be simplified without losing customers.

How to Answer:  
Use the most recent NPS or customer loyalty data. If unavailable, consult customer success teams or survey results. Don’t guess, mark unknown if uncertain.

Clarification:  
This question distinguishes between brand equity rooted in identity vs. in customer experience. A high NPS based on product or service interaction supports simplified branding.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:CSplit “\<30” and “Unknown” into separate scoring outcomes to avoid false assumptions and improve accuracy.

🔹 Z3 Q37 – Third-Party Recognition

| \# | Question | Category | Type | Scoring | Zone Tally |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 37 | Do analysts, industry partners, or trade media regularly reference this brand on its own—without mentioning Hexagon? | External Reference | Binary | Yes \= \+2 Z3A, No \= \+1 Z3B | ✔ \+2 Z3A / \+1 Z3B |

Please select one:  
☐ Yes – The brand is frequently cited by third parties on its own, suggesting strong standalone reputation → Z3A candidate (+2)  
☐ No – The brand is typically recognized only in Hexagon context, but may still carry value for internal or niche audiences → Z3B candidate (+1)

Why We Ask:  
Independent third-party recognition strengthens the case for visual brand retention in Z3A. However, lower visibility may still justify Z3B treatment, especially if internal or sector-specific value exists.

How to Answer:  
Base your response on general familiarity within your team. Consider whether your brand is often mentioned independently in analyst reports, partner conversations, or trade events. If you’re unsure, think about whether your external stakeholders tend to recognize and reference the brand without needing to mention Hexagon.

Clarification:  
This question distinguishes between brands with recognized market authority and those known mostly through Hexagon affiliation. Both are valid but inform different sub-zone placements.

NOTES FROM FEEDBACK:Revised to ensure a “No” response still provides guidance for sub-zone placement. Adjusted scoring to reflect mid-tier equity for Z3B.
